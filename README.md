### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently learning some QAs techs using Alura courses and talking with some friends. Just getting started in development and learning a lot.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on software test or in software development.

âš¡ Fun fact: IÂ´m a boy scout. (once a scout always a scout).
